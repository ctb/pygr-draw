pygr_draw provides a simple, robust way to draw features on
sequences.  It's primarily intended to address the "overlap" problem,
where you need to efficiently draw potentially stacked features.  It
uses `pygr <http://pygr.org/>`__ underneath, so it's pretty scalable
and (more importantly) you can swap in pygr-compatible components
depending on what you're doing.

Basic examples
--------------

`Simple annotation example <simple-example.html>`__ - blobs on sequences.

`Group annotation example <group-example.html>`__ -- gene structures, etc.

TODO: JSON output example.

Working with pygr objects
-------------------------

TODO: working with pygr annotations.

`Working with pygr alignments <wrapper-example.html>`__ -- displaying existing Multiple Sequence Alignments etc.

Contributors
------------

Marie Buckner and Owen Pierce both worked on early versions of pygr_draw,
helping find, debug, and fix some of the more annoying scaling issues.

Evan Bowling provided the inspiration for the JSON feature output.
