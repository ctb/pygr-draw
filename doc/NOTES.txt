From lyorn, to view your files thru the Web: ::

   mkdir ~/.html
   ln -fs /path/to/pygr-draw /u/<username>/.html

(replace /path/to/ and <username> appropriately). Now the files should
be accessible at

   http://lyorn.idyll.org/~<username>/pygr-draw/

JavaScript toolkit/drawing options:

Some good references in there; ixany on SVG, but check out

   http://plugins.jquery.com/project/Draw

We can always go with image maps, if necessary, but they're not as nice
as JS could be.
