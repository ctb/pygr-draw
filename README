To run .py files in doc/, you have to set up the environment properly.
First, set the PYTHONPATH: start in the top level pygr-draw directory and do,
::

   export PYTHONPATH=`pwd`
   cd doc/

Then you can run the various examples, e.g. ::

   python simple-example.py
   python group-example.py

To run all the doctests, do ::

   python run-doctests.py *.txt

or to run a single one, do ::

   python run-doctests.py simple-example.txt

From lyorn, to view your files thru the Web: ::

   mkdir ~/.html
   ln -fs /path/to/pygr-draw /u/<username>/.html

(replace /path/to/ and <username> appropriately). Now the files should
be accessible at

   http://lyorn.idyll.org/~<username>/pygr-draw/
